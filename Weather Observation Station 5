/*
* Query the two cities in STATION with the shortest and longest CITY names, as well as their respective lengths (i.e.: number of characters in the name). 
* If there is more than one smallest or largest city, choose the one that comes first when ordered alphabetically. 
*
* When ordered alphabetically, the CITY names are listed as ABC, DEF, PQRS, and WXY, with lengths 3, 3, 4, and 3. 
* The longest name is PQRS, but there are 3 options for shortest named city. Choose ABC, because it comes first alphabetically.
*/ 

Note: You can write two separate queries to get the desired output. It need not be a single query. 

SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGTH(CITY) ASC, CITY LIMIT 1;

SELECT CITY, LENGTH(CITY) FROM STATION
ORDER BY LENGHT(CITY) DESC, CITY LIMIT 1;
