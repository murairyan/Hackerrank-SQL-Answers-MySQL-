* (i.e.: enclosed in parentheses). For example: AnActorName(A), ADoctorName(D), AProfessorName(P), and ASingerName(S).
* 2) Query the number of ocurrences of each occupation in OCCUPATIONS. Sort the occurrences in ascending order.
*
* where [occupation_count] is the number of occurrences of an occupation in OCCUPATIONS and [occupation] is the lowercase occupation name.
* If more than one Occupation has the same [occupation_count], they should be ordered alphabetically.

Explanation:
The results of the first query are formatted to the problem description's specifications. 
The results of the second query are ascendingly ordered first by number of names corresponding to each profession (2 <= 2 <= 3 <= 3), 
and then alphabetically by profession (doctor <= singer, and actor <= professor).
